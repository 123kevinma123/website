            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspHey! I'm Kevin Ma, the creator of this website, currently a 
            Junior in Computer Science attending Purdue University. In my free
            time, I hang out with friends, play the violin, and code side projects such as this website.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe first iteration of this website was rather boring.
            It lacked something unique and fresh. Around Christmas, I received a video game called
            UNDERTALE, which had a pixelated esque artstyle. This drew my attention, and I became
            fixated on the idea of a retro-inspired website. This website is the result of that fixation.

            <br>
            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver time, I plan on creating and adding some retro video games under the 
            "Play Games" section to both sharpen my programming skills and add a fun element
            to my website. There are still many formatting issues and feature I want to address,
            but the website is coming along nicely so far!
