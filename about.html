            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspHey! I'm Kevin Ma, the creator of this website. I'm currently a 
            sophmore in Computer Science attending Purdue University. In my free
            time, I enjoy chilling with friends, playing the violin, or coding side 
            projects such as this website.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe first iteration of this website was just a typical run of the mill website.
            It lacked something special and unique. Frankly, I didn't feel the spark to
            actively try and improve on it. Around Christmas, I received a video game called
            UNDERTALE, which had a pixelated esque artstyle. This drew my attention, and I became
            rather fixated on the idea of a retro-inspired website. Thus, this website became
            a passion project for me.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver the summer, I plan on creating and adding some retro video games under the 
            "Play Games" section to both sharpen my programming skills and add a fun element
            to my website. There are still many formatting issues and feature I want to address,
            but the website is coming along nicely so far!
