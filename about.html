            Hey! I'm Kevin Ma, the creator of this website, currently a 
            Junior in Computer Science attending Purdue University. In my free
            time, I hang out with friends, play the violin, and code side projects such as this website.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspI love the retro-esque feeling of 8 bit games, particularly
            Space Invaders. I'm also a big fan of Star Wars. This led to the space themed 
            website you see now.

            &nbsp&nbsp&nbspOver time, I plan on creating and adding some retro video games under the 
            "Play Games" section to both sharpen my programming skills and add a fun element
            to my website. There are still many formatting issues and feature I want to address,
            but the website is coming along nicely so far!
